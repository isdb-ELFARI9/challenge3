  "change_summary": "We've updated FAS 4 to provide specific guidance on how it applies to diminishing Musharaka (shirkah al-ʿaqd) structures, particularly in real estate funds. The changes focus on clarifying the accounting treatment for partner contributions and exits, which were previously unclear.\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n*   **Partner Contributions & Exits:** We've added clauses detailing how to account for initial and subsequent partner contributions, including using fair value to determine ownership percentages. The standard now also specifies how partner exits should be handled, again emphasizing fair value for ownership unit pricing.\n*   **Asset Valuation:** The updated standard emphasizes the use of fair value for asset valuation when partners contribute to or exit the Musharaka.\n*   **Disclosure Requirements:** Real estate funds using diminishing Musharaka must now disclose specific information, including ownership percentages (initial and current), valuation methods used for assets, terms of partner contributions and exits, the profit-sharing ratio, and any related party transactions.\n\nThese changes bring the accounting treatment in line with Shariah principles (specifically AAOIFI SS 12) and aim to ensure transparency and consistency in financial reporting for these types of funds. We've updated sections related to both general principles and measurement/disclosure within FAS 4.",
